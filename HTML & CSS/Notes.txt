This is because padding behaves a little weird for inline elements. You can set left and right padding on them, and it will work as expected:

1) creates spacing inside the element,

2) which results in making the element wider, which pushes elements around it accordingly.



BUT vertical padding (top and bottom) does not work like that:

1) it still creates spacing inside the element (top and bottom)

2) the element also becomes taller, BUT it will not push elements around it (above or below)!



From the POV of elements above/below them, its as if the padding-top and padding-bottom didn't exist. This causes the "boxes" of inline elements to overlap into others.
